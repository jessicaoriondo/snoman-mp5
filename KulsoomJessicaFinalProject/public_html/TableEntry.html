                <p><b><u>App Name: Do you want to build a snowman?</u></b></p> 
                <p>User gets to build a snowman of their liking using shapes provided to them.
                    The user can move, scale, rotate, change the color and delete an item.
                    After the user is done building their snowman, they can play a simple game 
                    where the user has to move their snowman (left or right) away from the falling icicles as long as they can. 
                    If the snowman got hit by the icicle, the game will be over and will display
                    how long the user survived.
                    The purpose of the application is to let users create and 
                    customize their own snowman character and then allow them to play with their creation.</p>
