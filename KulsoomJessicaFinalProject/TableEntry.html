                <p><b><u>Do you want to build a snowman?</u></b></p> 
                <p>Users can build a snowman of their liking using shapes provided to them.
                    The user can move, scale, rotate, change the color and delete any added shape.
                    After they are done building their snowman, the user can play a simple game 
                    where they have to move their snowman (left or right) away from the falling icicles as long as they can. 
                    If the snowman gets hit by the icicle, the game will be over and the app will display
                    how long the user survived.
                    The purpose of the application is to let users create and 
                    customize their own snowman character and then allow them to play with their creation.</p>
